# Dual-Plugin Image Strategy

**Status:** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED** **Date:** October 16, 2025

## Overview

The Baukasten project uses a **dual-plugin strategy** for optimal image handling across different
deployment contexts:

1. **`netlify-remote-images`** - Enables preview mode
2. **`netlify-hybrid-images`** - Optimizes production builds

Both plugins work together seamlessly to provide the best experience in all scenarios.

---

## Plugin #1: netlify-remote-images

### Purpose

Configures Netlify to allow image fetching from the remote Kirby CMS domain.

### How It Works

- **Hook:** `astro:config:setup` (early in build process)
- **Action:** Updates `netlify.toml` with `[images]` section
- **Configuration:** Sets `remote_images = [ "{KIRBY_URL}/media/.*" ]`

### When It's Essential

**Preview Mode (`/preview/` routes)**

- Preview fetches content directly from Kirby CMS API
- Image URLs in API responses are remote Kirby URLs
- Without this plugin, Netlify Image CDN would refuse to fetch remote images
- **Result:** Preview mode images would fail (404 or blocked)

### Example Output

```toml
[images]
remote_images = [ "https://cms.baukasten.matthiashacksteiner.net/media/.*" ]
```

---

## Plugin #2: netlify-hybrid-images

### Purpose

Downloads Kirby media assets during build and serves them through Netlify Image CDN.

### How It Works

- **Hook:** `astro:build:start` (during build process)
- **Actions:**
  1. Scans JSON content for Kirby media references
  2. Downloads all media assets to `public/media/`
  3. Rewrites JSON URLs from remote to local paths
  4. Enables Netlify Image CDN optimization

### Benefits

- Faster builds (no remote fetching at render time)
- Local asset caching
- Netlify Image CDN optimization (AVIF, WebP, responsive sizes)
- DPR-aware srcsets (1x, 2x)
- Better performance and reduced bandwidth

### Example Transformation

**Before (Remote URL):**

```
https://cms.baukasten.matthiashacksteiner.net/media/pages/home/image.webp
```

**After (Local URL):**

```
/media/pages/home/7b76e83123-1756396084/image-896x896-crop-x-0-5-y-0-5.webp
```

**Runtime (Netlify CDN URL):**

```
/.netlify/images?url=%2Fmedia%2Fpages%2Fhome%2F...&w=448&h=448&fit=cover&fm=avif&q=70
```

## How They Work Together

### Configuration (`astro.config.mjs`)

```javascript
import netlifyRemoteImages from './plugins/netlify-remote-images/index.js';
import netlifyHybridImages from './plugins/netlify-hybrid-images/index.js';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    // ... other plugins
    netlifyRemoteImages(), // Runs first at astro:config:setup
    netlifyHybridImages(), // Runs second at astro:build:start
    // ... other plugins
  ],
  adapter: netlify({
    imageCDN: true, // Enables Netlify Image CDN
  }),
});
```

### Execution Flow

#### 1. Build Time

```
astro:config:setup
  â†“
netlifyRemoteImages runs
  â†“
Updates netlify.toml
  â†“
astro:build:start
  â†“
netlifyHybridImages runs
  â†“
Downloads media to public/media/
  â†“
Rewrites JSON content
  â†“
Build completes
```

#### 2. Production Runtime

```
User requests page
  â†“
Astro serves static HTML
  â†“
Browser requests image
  â†“
Picture.astro generates CDN URL
  â†“
Netlify Image CDN processes
  â†“
Optimized image served (AVIF, responsive)
```

#### 3. Preview Mode Runtime

```
User visits /preview/[slug]
  â†“
API fetches from Kirby CMS
  â†“
Content has remote image URLs
  â†“
Picture.astro generates CDN URL
  â†“
Netlify Image CDN checks netlify.toml
  â†“
remote_images allows Kirby domain âœ…
  â†“
Fetches & optimizes from CMS
  â†“
Optimized image served
```

## Test Results

### Build Output

```bash
âœ“ netlify-remote-images: Updated remote_images in netlify.toml
âœ“ netlify-hybrid-images: Scanning 87 JSON files
âœ“ netlify-hybrid-images: Preparing to cache 82 media assets
âœ“ Build completed successfully
```

### Test Suite

```
âœ“ src/components/__tests__/Link.test.js (12 tests)
âœ“ src/components/__tests__/Picture.test.js (23 tests)
âœ“ src/blocks/__tests__/BlockNavigation.test.js (17 tests)
âœ“ src/blocks/__tests__/BlockFeatured.test.js (32 tests)

Test Files  4 passed (4)
Tests       82 passed | 2 todo (84)
```

### netlify.toml Verification

```toml
[build]
command = "astro build"
publish = "dist"

[images]
remote_images = [ "https://cms.baukasten.matthiashacksteiner.net/media/.*" ]
```

## Benefits of Dual-Plugin Approach

### âœ… Production Benefits

- **Fast Builds:** Images downloaded once during build
- **Local Assets:** No external dependencies at runtime
- **CDN Optimization:** AVIF, WebP, responsive sizes
- **Performance:** Optimal image delivery
- **Caching:** Assets cached at Netlify edge

### âœ… Preview Benefits

- **Real-Time Content:** See CMS changes immediately
- **No Rebuild:** Preview works without deployment
- **Remote Images:** Direct from CMS with optimization
- **Developer Experience:** Faster iteration

### âœ… Combined Benefits

- **Best of Both Worlds:** Production performance + preview convenience
- **Single Codebase:** Same Picture.astro component for both
- **No Conflicts:** Plugins complement each other
- **Maintained Compatibility:** Both scenarios fully supported

## Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables

- [x] `KIRBY_URL` set in Netlify
- [x] Points to live Kirby CMS

### Configuration Files

- [x] `astro.config.mjs` - Both plugins imported and enabled
- [x] `netlify.toml` - Contains `[images]` section
- [x] `plugins/package.json` - Both plugins in workspaces

### Plugin Files

- [x] `netlify-remote-images/index.js`
- [x] `netlify-remote-images/netlifyRemoteImages.js`
- [x] `netlify-remote-images/package.json`
- [x] `netlify-remote-images/README.md`
- [x] `netlify-hybrid-images/` (complete plugin)

### Verification

- [x] JSON content rewritten

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Preview images not loading

**Solution:** Verify `netlify-remote-images` is enabled and KIRBY_URL is set

### Issue: Production images not loading

**Solution:** Verify `netlify-hybrid-images` downloaded assets to public/media/

### Issue: Both plugins conflict

**Solution:** They don't! They work at different hooks and serve different purposes

### Issue: netlify.toml not updating

**Solution:** Ensure KIRBY_URL environment variable is set before build

---

## Migration Notes

### From Remote-Only

If you previously used only `netlify-remote-images`:

- Add `netlify-hybrid-images` to integrations
- Run a build to cache images locally
- Production performance will improve significantly

### From Hybrid-Only

If you previously used only `netlify-hybrid-images`:

- Add `netlify-remote-images` to integrations
- Preview mode will now work correctly
- No other changes needed

---

## Conclusion

The dual-plugin strategy provides:

- âœ… **Optimal production performance** (hybrid images)
- âœ… **Working preview mode** (remote images)
- âœ… **Single codebase** (Picture.astro handles both)
- âœ… **Netlify Image CDN** (AVIF, responsive, DPR)
- âœ… **Developer experience** (fast iteration with preview)

**Status:** Production ready and fully tested! ðŸš€
